# INTRODUCTION-TO-CRYPTOGRAPHY
THIS IS JUST A BASIC TRY TO LEARN CRYPTOGRAPHY USING PYTHON LANGUAGE

so firstly, install hashlib library
for python 2.6 and newer versions  hashlib library already exists in genral modules (so, there is no need to install)
whereas for previous version you have to install hashlib library using following command
pip install hashlib
# soon will make multiple private things public( SMPC based stuff)
peace out
