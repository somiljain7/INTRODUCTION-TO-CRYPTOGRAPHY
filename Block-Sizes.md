Some algorithms use “block ciphers”, which encrypt and decrypt data in blocks (fixed length groups of bits). There is a relationship between block size and the amount of data that can be encrypted without duplicating blocks, the explanation of which is beyond the scope of this post, but the key takeaway is that the current recommendation is to use at least 128 bit blocks.
