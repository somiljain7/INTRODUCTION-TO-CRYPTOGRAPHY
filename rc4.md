RC4

RC4 was designed by Ron Rivest in 1987 initially as a trade secret until it was posted in the Cypherpunks mailing list in 1994. Once it got out to the sci-crypt newsgroup, it was quickly broken by Bob Jenkins. The algorithm has never been officially released by RSA Security but it has been used in some encryption protocols and standards such as WEP in 1997, WPA in 2003, SSL in 1995 and TLS in 1999 until it was prohibited in all versions of TLS RFC 7465 in 2015.

In Use Today? â€“ No. Recommended that this is not used.
