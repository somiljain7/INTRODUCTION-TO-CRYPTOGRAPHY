AES

The Advanced Encryption Standard or AES was established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES has been adopted by the US government with key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits.

AES has a fairly simple mathematical framework that some argue makes it susceptible to attack. The theoretical XSL attack was announced in 2002 and since then security researchers such as Bruce Schneier have found ways to exploit parts of the algorithm. However, it is important to note that even in Bruce Schneier’s article, he states that there is no reason to panic just yet since they only break 11 of the full 14 rounds of AES-256, taking 270 time. It also requires the cryptographer to have access to plaintexts encrypted with related multiple keys, which still gives AES a higher safety margin but just not as high as previously thought.

In Use Today? – Yes! AES is still in wide use today for its better processing power and ability to be used in a wide range of hardware like smart cards and high-performance computers.
