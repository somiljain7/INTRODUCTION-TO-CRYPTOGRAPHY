DES

The Data Encryption Standard or DES was, and probably still is, one of the more well-known algorithms of the modern cryptographic era. Today it is widely considered insecure. DES was developed in the 1970’s by IBM and was later submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and National Security Agency (NSA). The involvement of the NSA in the design sparked controversial rumours of backdoors, creating widespread scrutiny. It wasn’t until 1976 that DES was approved as a cryptographic standard and published in FIPS.

In the 1990’s, computing 72 quadrillion possible keys for a 56 bit DES key seemed highly improbable. This would have been true for one computer, but in 1997 a group of computer scientists led by Rocke Verser used thousands of volunteer computers to crack DES within 24 hours, thereby making him and his team the winner of the $10,000 DES Challenge.

Since then, DES was fortified with new updates called double-DES and triple-DES, simply layering the cipher so that it would have to decrypt three times to each data block. Triple-DES is still used in some places, but AES (see below) has become the new standard since then.

In Use Today? – DES and double-DES are no longer in use, but triple-DES with three keys is still a recommended algorithm in NIST SP 800-57. It is much slower to use than the AES algorithm, but is still seen in the electronic payment industry. It is also used in Microsoft OneNote and Outlook 2007 to protect user content and system data and the browsers Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird in CBC mode to encrypt website authentication login credentials when using a master password.
