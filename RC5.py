RC5

Ron Rivest designed RC5 in 1994 to be variable on all fronts. Block sizes can vary from 32, 64 or 128 bits and key sizes from 0-2040 bits and rounds from 0-255. The original suggestion for parameters was 64-bit block, 128-bit key and 12 rounds.

In Use Today? â€“ Distributed.net are working on brute-force attacks on RC5. They have cracked the 56-bit key in 250 days and the 64-bit key in 1,757 days. They are still working on the 72-bit key, arguably still making it safe to use.
