Encryption Key Sizes

Key size or key length refers to the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm. Only the correct key can decrypt a ciphertext (output) back into plaintext (input). As CPU power gets more advanced, the computational time required to brute force an encryption key gets less and less. As such, keys have had to become longer. For many years the limit was 40-bits, but today we are seeing up to 4096-bit key lengths in cryptography.
