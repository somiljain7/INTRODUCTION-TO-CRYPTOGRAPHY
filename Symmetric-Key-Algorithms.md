Symmetric Key Algorithms

symmetric algorithms

A symmetric key algorithm (also known as a secret key algorithm), uses the concept of a key and lock to encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext data. The same “key” is used to both encrypt and decrypt the file. They are sub-classified by stream ciphers and block ciphers. A stream cipher is where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudo-random cipher digit stream. Block ciphers take the number of bits and encrypt them as a single unit (known as rounds), padding the plaintext so that it’s a multiple of a block size.

The algorithm itself is not kept a secret and the sender and receiver of communication must both have copies of the secret key in a secure place. The use of the same key is also one of the drawbacks of symmetric key cryptography because if someone can get hold of the key, they can decrypt your data.
