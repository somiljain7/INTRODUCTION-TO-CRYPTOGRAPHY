Blowfish

Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher built by Bruce Schneier as a replacement to DES and IDEA. It takes variable key sizes from 32-bits to 448-bits, 64-bit block size and 16-rounds and was one of the first unpatented and license free block cipher (and still is). Serge Vaudenay, the French cryptographer found a way to use weak keys in a plaintext attack to recover 14 of the 16 rounds.

Blowfish has also been criticized for being slow in certain applications and vulnerable to Birthday Attacks in HTTPS.

In Use Today? – No. While, it’s now know to be vulnerable to Sweet32 attack, birthday attacks and plaintext attacks, some applications are still using it, for example to encrypt passwords. Bruce Schneier now recommends the use of Twofish.
