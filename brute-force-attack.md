Brute Force Attack

A brute force attack or a dictionary attack as it’s also known is a trial and error method of obtaining the private key of an encrypted packet of data. The trial and error is done by a computer so the higher the computational power, the more “tries” it can have in a short space of time. As computing power and performance increases, the ability to find the private key increases, unless you increase the length of the key so that a higher number of possibilities exist.
