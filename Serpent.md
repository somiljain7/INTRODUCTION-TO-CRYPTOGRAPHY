Serpent

Serpent was also entered into the Advanced Encryption Standard competition and was actually ranked second to Rijndael (now known as AES). Serpent was designed in 1998 by Ross Anderson, Eli Buham and Lars Knudsen. It has a block size of 128-bits, 192 or 256-bits with a block length of 128-bits and 32 rounds. Rijndael won over Serpent because judges deemed that it has more efficient software implementations.

In 2001, Eli Burham alongside Orr Dunkelman and Nathan Keller were able to break 10 of 32 rounds of Serpent-128 with 2118 known plaintexts and 289 of time. They could also break Serpent-192/256 with 2118 plaintext and 2187 time. Other papers have since come closer, breaking up to 12 rounds but still not close enough to consider the algorithm weak.

In Use Today? â€“ Yes. Serpent is still in the public domain and while some attacks have managed to get through up to 12 rounds of the full 32, the time and energy needed for such an attack is still quite large.
Asymmetric Algorithms

asymmetric algorithms

Asymmetric cryptography is also known as public key cryptography and is based on the principle of having a pair of mathematically-related keys for encryption and decryption: a public key and a private key. The public key pair can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret. Anyone with the public key can encrypt a message but only the holder of a private key can decrypt it. Security depends on the secrecy of the private keys.
