RC 2

Rivest’s cipher, Ron’s code or, more commonly, RC algorithms were invented by Ron Rivest. While they share the same family name, the algorithms are quite different. For the purposes of this article, we will separate the names out.

Starting with RC2, which Ron Rivest created in 1987, is a 64-bit block cipher with variable key sizes and 18 rounds, arranged as a heavy unbalanced Feistel network (16 rounds on one type and two rounds on another).

In Use Today? – No. Recommended that this is not used. It is vulnerable to a related-key attack using 234 chosen plaintexts.
