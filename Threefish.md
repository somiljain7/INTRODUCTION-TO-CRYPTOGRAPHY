Threefish

Threefish worked on 256-bit, 512-bit and 1024-bit blocks with the same key sizes as the block and up to 80 rounds. Threefish was created in 2008 as part of the Skein Hash Function, one of five finalists of the NIST’s SHA-3 hash function competition. Threefish was heralded for its speed; Threefish-512 can encrypt data at 6.1 block cycles per byte on a 64-bit machine.

In Use Today? – Yes. Still available to use patent-free. However, in October 2010, an attack was published that could break 53 of 72 rounds in Threefish-256 and 57 of 72 rounds in Threefish-512, so it could still be risky to use Threefish.
