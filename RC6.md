RC6

RC6 was derived from RC5 by Ron Rivest and colleagues. It was designed to meet the requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition and managed to become one of the five finalists. It has a block size of 128-bits and supported key sizes of 128, 192, 256-bits and up to 2040-bits. RC6, like RC5, uses data-dependent rotations, modular addition and XOR operations. The algorithm was not chosen because the RSA Security website suggested that the algorithm was not yet royalty free.

In Use Today? â€“ Leaked files from the NSA suggest that it was used in implant devices in 2016. Other than this, it looks like RC6 might still hold two patents in the US: US 5724428 A and US 5835600 A but the patents are set to expire between 2015-2017.
