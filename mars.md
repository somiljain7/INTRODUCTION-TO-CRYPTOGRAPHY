MARS

After DES was found to be weak, NIST ran an open call process known as the Advanced Encryption Standard Process from 1997 to 2000 to find a new and improved block cipher. MARS was one of the finalists, making it far for its layered, compartmentalized approach aimed at resisting future advances in cryptography and CPU power.

MARS supports 128-bit blocks and variable key sizes on a number of core and mixed rounds providing strong resistance to cryptographic attack. Critics suggested that subkeys with long runs of ones and zeroes may have led to an easy and effective attack on MARS.

In Use Today? â€“ No. 21 of 23 rounds of MARS were broken by Bruce Schneier and John Kelsey in 2004.
