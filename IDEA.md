The International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), originally called the Improved Proposed Encryption Standard (IPES), was designed by James Massey of ETH Zurich under a research contract with the Hasler Foundation, now Ascom Tech AG ,and was first discussed in 1991. IDEA was a minor revision of the Proposed Encryption Standard (PES), intended as a replacement of the DES.

IDEA is now patent-free and thus completely free for all uses, but the name itself is still trademarked. It operated on a 64-bit block using 128-bit key and is still an optional algorithm in the OpenPGP standard. Bruce Schneier spoke highly of this algorithm in 1996 until such a time as the patents became difficult to put it into use and the speed of the algorithm couldn’t keep up with modern technology.

IDEA’s full 8.5 round algorithm was first broken in 2011 using a meet-in-the-middle attack and independently in 2012 using a narrow-bicliques attack. In May 2005, MediaCrypt announced a successor of IDEA called IDEA NXT. 

In Use Today? – Not widely used, but is now patent-free to use in applications of your choice.
