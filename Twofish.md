Twofish

Twofish is Blowfish’s successor published in 1998. With a block size of 128-bits, key sizes up to 256-bits and 16 rounds, it became one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition but was not selected for standardization. It was a step up from Blowfish in that it could be implemented on hardware and smartcards as well as large microprocessors.

Bruce Schneier and the team that created Twofish offered a $10,000 prize for anyone who could attack it during its first round of AES evaluation. In 1999, Sean Murphy and Fauzan Mirza won the prize for their paper, ‘An Observation on the Key Schedule of Twofish’.
